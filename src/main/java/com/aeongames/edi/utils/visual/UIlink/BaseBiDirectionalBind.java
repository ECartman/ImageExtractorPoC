 *
 * this is A Bidirectional POJO({@link ListenableProperty}) to VisualComponent
 * bind Class. is important to note this Class defines a Binder that
 * <strong>can</strong>
 * bind Bidirectionally. however is up to the specific implementation if the
 * class notifies back and forth the changes on the UI to POJO and the other way
 * it is also important to note that this class defines a Bidirectional Bind to
 * 1:1
 * <br>
 * meaning it can bind up to 1 POJO and up to 1 UI component. if You need a 1:N
 * binding. please refer to {@link CachedUniDirectionalBind } or
 * {@link UniDirBroadcastBind}
 * <br>
 * please note that this class does not cache the changes. and does not
 * guarantee that the value would stay unchanged until updated on the UI. (this
 * means that the property <strong>could</strong> change between the time the
 * property request a change. and the time the UI updates, the UI will setup the
 * value that is currently at {@link ListenableProperty#getValue}
 * <br>
 * thus. this Binding is not recommended to be used when you require to update
 * multiple Components with the same Property.
 *
 * TODO: support Binding A error Listener. as some bindings might cause errors
 * when posting values to the UI, for example {@link JSpinner} can fail when
 * updating the value IllegalArgumentException - if value isn't allowed and we
 * have no way to tell the POJO Back that the Property Could not be updated
