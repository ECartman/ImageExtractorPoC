/**
 *
 * Preface: java AWT implementation to read the Clipboard is bad because it
 * hides a lot of nuance and computation that might happens. and does not
 * disclose nuances.
 *
 * when pulling data from the Clipboard the best approach for long chunks of
 * data (and do note that the clipboard has no limit on the amount of data it
 * could hold is best to use a stream. as a Stream remove some overhead from
 * other ways. and provide a finer Control unfortunately it still imply some
 * overhead. due char Encoding. according to the JDK code at
 * <code>DataTransfer.translateBytes</code> Target data is an InputStream. For
 * arbitrary flavors, just return // the raw bytes. For text flavors, decode to
 * strip terminators and // search-and-replace EOLN, then <Strong>re
 * encode</Strong> according to the requested // flavor. example:: at
 * java.nio.HeapCharBuffer.ix(HeapCharBuffer.java:162) at

 *
 * the Advantage of this approach is that you can process as much data as you
 * need to and stop as you deemed it has reached a point that is too much.
 * rather that awaiting on a stuck processing. for example using another
 * approach would be:
 *
 *
 * that most of my Rant is on regards of the general abstract code and the
 * specific Windows implementation.
 *
 * 1) the Clipboard pre-gathers the clipboard data upon request so for example
 * from the moment you get the "Transferable object" it PREFETCHS the
 * information as far as i have seen it might pre fetch partial but seems to do
 * the totality of the data when playing with plain text. on
 * sun.awt.datatransfer.ClipboardTransferable class, now this would not be a big
 * deal if this were properly documented but it is not, on the abstraction and
 * the specification is hidden on the "SUN" dreaded package. furthermore the
 * documentation on this class source is not the best.
 *
 * This hybrid pre-fetch/delayed-rendering approach allows us to circumvent the
 * API restriction(WHICH API????) that client code cannot lock the Clipboard to
 * discover its formats before requesting data in a particular format, while
 * avoiding the overhead of fully rendering all data ahead of time. (this does
 * not seem to be true)
 *
 * now up to this point this is passable as what it is doing is gathering the
 * SYSTEM(OS) (assuming the clipboard is the os /system one) clipboard now the
 * pre fetching is all good stuff. it MIGHT consume a good chunk of memory. but
 * might be safer as the content might change if not fetched? then if you call
 * the transferable getTransferData([whatever]);
 *
 * here is where problems might arise. because when the data is text the JDK sun
 * code will NO MATTER THE FLAVOR take the data, and parse it into a String and
 * then provide the bytes. is is extremely wasteful and potentially slow. for
 * one. if I setup a flavor to handle the data as bytes why convert them into
 * string? if I desire to see the raw data this process will hinder that as it
 * does conversion via charset. this imagine this: the text is UTF-8 java will
 * parse to UTF-16, then parse back to UTF-8 and furthermore as a string.
 * meaning it will waste space on the string pool for that COULD be possibly
 * CONFIDENTIAL and require secure handling
 *
 * now generally speaking. besides the SECURITY problem the other issue is that
 * i am facing working on this code can hold A LOT of data. and that causes
 * performance and memory consumptions problems Raymond Chen himself. states
 * "No, there is no pre-set maximum size for clipboard data. You are limited
 * only by available memory and address space"
 *
 * https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220608-00/?p=106727
 *
 * so when java pulls the data initially it hast its raw bytes. but upon asking
 * for something workable. it try's to translate them... is extremely annoying.
 *
 * windows nuance:

/**
 * ClipboardService defines a service or background (thread/runnable) that will
 * await and process changes from the system clipboard.<br> 
 * The clipboard changes will be listened by the service own interface (itself)
 * ({@link FlavorListener}). and when detected it will set a trigger for the service
 * thread to check and process, thus note there might be a delay between the time
 * the clipboard changes and the time the thread is able to process the change. 
 * <br>
 * NOTE: this class does NOT process the clipboard changes in the EDT,
 * this is intentional as per design, as working with the EDT would cause
 * irresponsive UI, or delays
 * <br>
 * this service by itself does not handle the data. the interested need to register
 * a {@link FlavorProcessor} and register using 
 * {@link ClipboardService#addFlavorHandler(com.aeongames.edi.utils.Clipboard.FlavorProcessor, java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor...) }
 * or
 * {@link ClipboardService#addPriorityFlavorHandler(com.aeongames.edi.utils.Clipboard.FlavorProcessor, java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor...) }
 * once register the service will call this interface to handle the clipboard data.
 * <br>
 * NOTE: a Clipboard Event will be consider handled when the first possible Handler
 * reports that it has successfully handled the event. and no other listener will
 * be called, it allow to register multiple handlers. (sort of a hybrid Unicast event)
